# SPFx Ticket Form

## Disclaimer

**⚠️ This project is for demonstration purposes only. It is not intended for production use or distribution.**

## Summary

Help desk ticketing form that handles the submission of tickets to a SharePoint list.

Files attached to a form submission are uploaded to a document library in a named folder associated with the ID of the created list item.

Backend logic powered by Microsoft Power Automate. Used to handle workflows, approvals, and data processing without a traditional server-side backend.

## Note

This is my first project working with SPFx, TypeScript and Sass. It was designed to replace the IT ticketing system of my current company with a modern SharePoint solution.

API calls are handled in TicketForm.tsx and the endpoints are specific to the company's SharePoint site layout.
